          <h3>The Defects Documentation Process</h3>

          <h4>Step 1: Mark Physical Defects</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Use blue painter's tape to mark issues</li>
            <li>Number each defect sequentially</li>
            <li>Write number on tape with marker</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Step 2: Photograph Everything</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Take wide shot showing location</li>
            <li>Take close-up showing defect detail</li>
            <li>Include measuring tape for scale if relevant</li>
            <li>Ensure good lighting for clarity</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Step 3: Create Written List</h4>

            <li>Request acknowledgment of receipt</li>
            <li>Set rectification timeline (usually 7 days)</li>
