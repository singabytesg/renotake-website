UI/UX Review: RenoTake Website

üü¢ Strengths

1. Clear Visual Hierarchy
   - Excellent use of typography scales (4xl/5xl for H1,

2xl/3xl for H2) - Consistent spacing with Tailwind's spacing system - Good contrast with charcoal text on white backgrounds 2. Strong Brand Identity - Consistent green (#00A67E) primary color throughout - Clean logo with color emphasis ("Reno" + green
"Take") - Professional color palette aligned with Singapore
market 3. Mobile-First Responsive Design - Proper responsive breakpoints (sm/md/lg) - Mobile navigation with slide-out sheet - Touch-friendly button sizes (h-10, h-12) 4. Conversion-Focused Elements - Smart exit-intent popup for email capture - Multiple CTA placements without being pushy - Lead magnet (HDB Renovation Checklist)
well-positioned

üî¥ Critical Issues

1. Navigation Inconsistencies
   - Dead links in nav: /answers, /ask-renoai don't exist
   - Footer has broken links: /contact, /privacy
   - No 404 page handling for missing routes

2. Form Validation Gaps
   - Email validation too basic (only checks for "@")
   - No feedback for invalid inputs before submission
   - Missing loading states in some forms

3. Accessibility Problems
   - Missing alt text on some images
   - No skip-to-content link for keyboard navigation
   - Focus states inconsistent across components
   - Sheet component missing proper ARIA labels

   These are accessibility issues that make the website harder to use for people with disabilities. Let me explain each one:

Missing alt text on some images

- Screen readers can't describe images without alt text to blind users
- Search engines also use alt text for SEO
- Fix: Add descriptive alt attributes to all <Image> components

No skip-to-content link for keyboard navigation

- Keyboard users must tab through entire navigation before reaching main content
- Fix: Add a hidden link that becomes visible on focus, jumping to main content

Focus states inconsistent across components

- Some interactive elements don't clearly show when they're focused via keyboard
- Makes keyboard navigation difficult
- Fix: Ensure all buttons, links, inputs have visible focus rings

Sheet component missing proper ARIA labels

- The mobile menu (Sheet) lacks labels that screen readers need
- Users won't know what the menu is or its state (open/closed)
- Fix: Add aria-label, aria-expanded, and role attributes to Sheet components

These issues violate WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and hurt both accessibility and SEO.

üü° Areas for Improvement

1. Homepage Information Architecture
   - Hero section text too generic
   - Feature cards lack visual hierarchy
   - Quick Answer cards could be more scannable
   - Footer too dense on mobile

2. Component Consistency
   - Button variants used inconsistently (ghost vs

outline) - Card shadows vary (shadow-sm vs shadow-lg) - Icon sizes not standardized (h-4 vs h-5 vs h-6) 3. Mobile UX Issues - Fixed floating button in guides can obstruct content - Newsletter form on mobile needs better spacing - Horizontal scrolling on some tables 4. Performance Opportunities - Large Unsplash images in hero (should optimize) - No lazy loading for below-fold content - Missing image dimensions causing layout shift

üöÄ Recommendations

1. Immediate Fixes
   // Fix navigation dead links

- Remove non-existent routes from nav
- Create placeholder pages or redirect
- Implement proper 404 page

2. Enhanced Mobile Experience
   - Replace fixed floating button with sticky bottom nav
   - Improve touch targets (min 44x44px)
   - Add horizontal scroll indicators for tables

3. Accessibility Improvements
   - Add skip navigation link
   - Implement proper focus management
   - Add ARIA labels to interactive elements
   - Ensure all images have descriptive alt text

4. Visual Polish
   - Standardize shadow usage (create design tokens)
   - Consistent icon sizing system
   - Add subtle animations for micro-interactions
   - Implement skeleton loaders for async content

5. Conversion Optimization
   - A/B test popup timing (30s might be too long)
   - Add progress indicators in multi-step guides
   - Social proof elements (testimonials, numbers)
   - Trust badges for data security

6. Content Presentation
   - Add reading time estimates consistently
   - Implement table of contents for long guides
   - Better visual separation between sections
   - Add "Back to top" button for long pages

‚è∫ Priority Action Items

Week 1:

- Fix broken navigation links
- Implement proper 404 page
- Add alt text to all images
- Fix email validation

Week 2:

- Standardize component styling (shadows, icons)
- Improve mobile navigation UX
- Add accessibility features (skip links, ARIA)
- Optimize hero images

Week 3:

- Enhance forms with better validation
- Add loading/skeleton states
- Implement proper focus management
- Polish micro-interactions

The codebase shows good foundational UX patterns with
room for refinement in consistency, accessibility, and
mobile optimization. The conversion-focused elements are
well-placed but need technical polish for production
readiness.
