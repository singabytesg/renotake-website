## **Part 3: When to Splurge vs Save**

### **The S$20,000 Question: Where Should Your Money Go?**

Strategic spending separates a smart renovation from a regrettable one. This section reveals exactly where to invest for long-term value and where to cut costs without compromising quality.

### **The Splurge List: Invest Here for 10+ Years of Value**

#### **1. Waterproofing (ROI: Infinite)**

**Splurge Budget: S$600–S$1,000 per toilet**

Never compromise on waterproofing. A failure here means:

- S$10,000–S$30,000 in damages
- Legal liability to neighbors below
- Complete bathroom tear-down
- 3-6 months of disputes

**Smart Splurge Strategy**:

- Use only HDB-approved membrane systems
- Insist on 2-3 coats (not just one)
- Request 5-year warranty minimum
- Document the application process

#### **2. Electrical Infrastructure (ROI: 15 years daily use)**

**Splurge Budget: S$3,000–S$5,000**

Under-investing here means extension cords everywhere and future hacking.

**Smart Splurge Strategy**:

- Add 30-40% more points than you think you need
- Install USB points in every room
- Use quality MCB/RCCB breakers
- Plan for future needs (EV charging, home office)

**Cost Comparison**:

- During renovation: S$100 per point
- After renovation: S$300+ per point (includes hacking)

#### **3. Carpentry Hardware (ROI: 20 years of smooth operation)**

**Splurge Budget: +S$800–S$1,500 above standard**

The difference between quality and standard hardware:

| **Component**      | **Standard** | **Premium (Blum/Hafele)** | **Lifespan Difference**  |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Hinges**         | S$3–S$5      | S$15–S$25                 | 5 years vs 20 years      |
| **Drawer Runners** | S$8–S$12     | S$40–S$60                 | 3 years vs 15 years      |
| **Soft-Close**     | Not included | S$20–S$30                 | Night and day difference |

#### **4. Kitchen Countertop (ROI: 15-20 years)**

**Splurge Budget: S$1,500–S$2,500**

| **Material**   | **Cost (10ft)** | **Lifespan** | **Maintenance**      | **Verdict**        |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Laminate**   | S$500–S$700     | 3-5 years    | High, easily damaged | Save here          |
| **Kompacplus** | S$800–S$1,000   | 5-8 years    | Medium               | Minimum acceptable |
| **Quartz**     | S$1,500–S$1,800 | 15+ years    | Low                  | Sweet spot         |
| **Sintered**   | S$2,000–S$2,800 | 20+ years    | None                 | Premium choice     |

#### **5. Main Door Digital Lock (ROI: Security + Convenience)**

### **Payment Milestone Protection Strategy**

#### **Safe Payment Schedule Template**
