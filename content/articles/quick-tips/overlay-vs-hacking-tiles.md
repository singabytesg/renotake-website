# Overlay vs Hacking: We Tested Both in Identical Sengkang Units (Results Inside)

Two identical 4-room BTOs. Same block, same floor plan, same contractor. One hacked everything, one overlaid everything. Two years later, the results will change how you renovate.

My neighbor and I collected keys the same day. We became the perfect renovation experiment neither of us planned. The results? One of us wasted $5,000.

## The Real Story

Block 455C Sengkang, February 2022. David (unit #08-123) and I (unit #08-125) stood in our identical empty flats, discussing renovation plans. Same contractor gave us the ultimatum: "Must hack all floors, if not tiles confirm pop."

David believed him. I didn't.

While his unit became a war zone of drilling and dust for three weeks, mine got vinyl planks laid directly over existing tiles in three days. His bill: $8,500 for hacking and retiling. Mine: $3,500 for overlay.

Fast forward to last month—exactly two years later. We did the inspection together. David's tiles? Two hairline cracks in the living room, one tile slightly lifted near the kitchen. My overlay? Perfect. Not a single bubble, lift, or crack.

"Waste my money for what?" David still curses when he sees my floor.

But here's where it gets interesting. We surveyed our entire block. 31 units renovated around the same time:

- 19 hacked (average cost: $8,000-10,000)
- 12 overlaid (average cost: $3,000-4,500)

Failure rate after two years:

- Hacked floors: 4 units with problems (21%)
- Overlaid floors: 1 unit with problems (8%)

The one overlay failure? They used the cheapest contractor who didn't level the floor first. Even then, only small section affected.

## What Most People Don't Know

After extensive research and interviews with flooring specialists (not general contractors), here's the truth about overlay vs hacking:

**When Overlay Works (90% of cases):**

- BTO tiles are level (use marbles test—if marbles don't roll, you're good)
- No hollow tiles (tap test—uniform sound means solid)
- Height increase acceptable (usually 5-12mm)
- Using quality vinyl or laminate (SPC minimum 4mm thick)

**When Hacking is Necessary (10% of cases):**

- Severe hollowness (over 30% of floor area)
- Damaged/cracked existing tiles
- Major leveling issues (>10mm variation)
- Changing to heavy stone/marble flooring

**The Science Behind Success:**
Modern vinyl planks are engineered to float. They don't need perfect substrates like tiles do. The interlocking system distributes weight across the entire floor. Your existing tiles become merely a stable base, not the final surface.

**Cost Breakdown Reality:**

_Hacking Route:_

- Hacking labor: $2,500
- Disposal: $800
- New cement screed: $1,500
- Waterproofing: $800
- New tiles: $2,000
- Tiling labor: $2,000
- Total: $9,600

_Overlay Route:_

- Floor leveling compound: $500
- Underlay: $300
- SPC vinyl: $2,000
- Installation: $1,000
- Total: $3,800

Difference: $5,800 (enough for your entire kitchen renovation)

**The Contractor's Motivation:**
Why do contractors push hacking? Simple math. They make $2,500 just from hacking labor, plus markup on disposal, screening, and retiling. Overlay? They make maybe $500 on installation. Where would you push your customers?

## The Jurong Test Case

The ultimate test came from Block 168 Jurong West. An enthusiast owner documented 24 units over three years:

**Year 1:** All floors looked perfect, both hacked and overlaid

**Year 2:**

- 2 hacked floors showed hairline cracks
- 1 overlaid floor had slight lifting (poor installation)

**Year 3:**

- 3 hacked floors had issues (cracks, loose tiles)
- 1 overlaid floor still had same minor lift
- Rest of both groups: perfect

His conclusion: "Hacking doesn't guarantee perfection. Good installation does, regardless of method."

Most revealing discovery: Units that hacked often had issues because new tiles were rushed. Contractors laid tiles on not-fully-cured cement to meet deadlines. These tiles later popped or cracked. The overlay units? No curing time needed, no rush, better results.

One couple even did a hybrid: overlay in bedrooms, hacked in wet areas only. Cost: $5,500. Perfect compromise.

## Your Action Plan

- **First call**: Get overlay specialist quote, not general contractor. Search "SPC flooring Singapore" not "renovation contractor."
- **This weekend**: Do the marble test. Place marbles on your floor. If they stay put, overlay is safe.
- **Before contractors arrive**: Tap every tile with a coin. Mark hollow ones. If less than 10%, overlay. More than 30%, consider hacking.
- **Red flag to watch**: Contractor who insists on hacking without doing any tests. He's thinking of his profit, not your floor.
- **Budget hack**: Overlay bedrooms/living, hack only kitchen/bathrooms if needed. Save 60% while addressing actual problem areas.

## The Bottom Line

Two years, 31 units, clear winner: overlay. Unless your existing floor is genuinely damaged, hacking is just expensive theater. That $5,000 saved? That's your furniture budget. Let your contractor sulk while you shop at IKEA.
