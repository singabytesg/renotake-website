The uncle at Hafary Balestier actually laughed. Not mockingly, more like how your dad laughs when you say you want to marry your Primary 2 crush.

"Wah, homogeneous for toilet also ah? Your money grow on tree is it?" He pulled out his calculator, punched some numbers, then showed me the screen. S$2,400. That's how much extra I was about to spend on putting premium tiles where nobody would ever notice or care.

## The Real Story

Like every new homeowner, I'd done my "research." Five YouTube videos, three blog posts, and my colleague's advice: "Just go homogeneous for everything lah, last longer." Armed with this wisdom, I walked into that massive Hafary showroom on Balestier Road feeling like a renovation expert.

Then Uncle destroyed my confidence in 10 minutes.

He walked me to two tile displays. Knocked on both. Dropped his keys on both. Scraped a coin across both. "You tell me, which one homogeneous?"

I guessed wrong. Twice.

The "cheap ceramic" tile I pointed at? S$5.50 per square foot homogeneous. The "premium homogeneous" one? S$2.20 ceramic with good glazing. My eyes, my knocking test, my entire "research"—all useless.

Then he said something that changed my entire renovation: "You don't choose tiles by type. You choose by where they go."

## What Most People Don't Know

Here's the truth that tile suppliers won't volunteer: You're buying durability for spaces that don't need it. It's like wearing a Rolex to sleep—sure, it'll last, but why?

After visiting six tile shops from Balestier to Tradehub 21, plus getting burned by one contractor who tried to pass ceramic as homogeneous, here's what actually matters:

**The Living Room Test**: Your living room sees 1,000 footsteps daily. Your kid's toy cars. Furniture dragging. CNY mahjong tables. This needs homogeneous—the color goes all the way through. Chip it (unlikely), and you see the same color. S$3.50-6 per square foot? Worth it.

**The Bathroom Reality**: Your bathroom floor sees... your feet. Wet feet. That's it. Nobody's playing soccer in your toilet. Ceramic tiles at S$1.50-3 per square foot work perfectly. The money saved? That's your toilet bowl upgrade fund.

**The Kitchen Compromise**: Main floor needs homogeneous (dropping pots happens). But backsplash? Those pretty Peranakan-style ceramic tiles at S$2 per square foot are perfect. They're on the wall—unless you're throwing plates, they'll outlive you.

## The Ang Mo Kio Test Case

My neighbor at Block 538 Ang Mo Kio Ave 5 renovated the same month. Same 4-room layout. He went full homogeneous everywhere—even the bomb shelter. Cost: S$5,800 for tiles alone.

My approach after Uncle's education:

- Living/Dining/Bedrooms: Mid-range homogeneous (S$4/sqft)
- Bathrooms: Good ceramic (S$2.50/sqft)
- Kitchen floor: Homogeneous (S$4/sqft)
- Kitchen walls: Ceramic (S$2/sqft)
- Service yard: Basic ceramic (S$1.50/sqft)

My total: S$3,400. Same looking flat. Same durability where it matters. S$2,400 saved for that Samsung Frame TV my wife wanted.

Six months later, you cannot tell the difference. His bathroom doesn't look more "premium." My ceramic tiles haven't cracked. But my TV looks fantastic.

## Your Action Plan

- **This weekend**: Visit any tile shop, ask to see their "returns section"—these are tiles people over-ordered. Same quality, 40% discount.
- **The knock test is BS**: Stop knocking on tiles. Ask for the water absorption rate instead. <0.5% = homogeneous, 3-6% = ceramic.
- **Size matters**: 60x60cm for living areas (fewer grout lines, easier cleaning). 30x30cm for bathrooms (better grip, traditional look).
- **The origin truth**: Spanish/Italian tiles cost 3x China tiles. For ceramic in low-traffic areas, China tiles are fine. For main floor homogeneous, spend the extra for European.
- **Buy exactly 10% extra**: Not 5%, not 15%. Specifically 10%. Covers cutting waste and future repairs without over-buying.

## The Bottom Line

You need exactly two types of tiles: good homogeneous for where you walk, decent ceramic for everywhere else. That's it. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.

The tile uncle's parting wisdom: "You know what's the best tile? The one that's still there in 20 years. Everything else is just showing off to visitors who don't care."

### Conversation Starters

Team homogeneous-everything or team strategic-ceramic? What's the most ridiculous tile upsell you've heard? Did anyone actually regret not going full homogeneous?
