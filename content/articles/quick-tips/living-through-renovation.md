# Living Through Renovation Hell: My 14-Day Survival Guide for Staying Home During Works

Day 3: Showered at the gym. Day 7: Ate cup noodles on the corridor floor. Day 10: Seriously considered divorce. Day 14: Survived with marriage intact.

Living through renovation isn't just inconvenient—it's psychological warfare. But with the right strategy, you can emerge victorious (and still married). Here's my battle-tested survival guide.

## The Real Story

"Why not just stay at hotel?" everyone asked. Simple math: $150/night x 14 nights = $2,100. That's my entire bathroom upgrade. So my wife and I decided to tough it out in our Hougang 4-room while contractors tore it apart.

Day 1 started optimistically. We'd sealed off the master bedroom as our "safe zone," complete with portable aircon, mini-fridge, and enough snacks to survive zombie apocalypse. By noon, the dust had infiltrated everything. Our "sealed" room looked like Sahara Desert after sandstorm.

Day 2: Discovered contractor starts drilling at 7:58am. Not 8am. 7:58am. Every. Single. Day. "Early bird mah," he grinned when I stumbled out in underwear, looking murderous.

Day 5: The water got cut. "Forgot to tell you," contractor said. Showered at ActiveSG gym ($2.50 entry). Discovered half of Hougang had same idea. The uncle in the next shower stall? Also renovating.

Day 8: Kitchen demolished. Living on food delivery, but riders couldn't find our unit because contractors' materials blocked corridor. One rider left our McDonald's on the staircase. Found it two hours later. Still ate it.

Day 10: The breaking point. Dust everywhere. No proper toilet (plastic sheet situation). Workers smoking at my window. Wife crying. I seriously Googled "emergency couples therapy Singapore."

But Day 11, something clicked. We developed a system. A routine. We'd cracked the code to renovation survival.

## What Most People Don't Know

After surviving 14 days and interviewing 20 other "renovation survivors," here's the strategic guide to living through renovation:

**THE ZONE SYSTEM**
Divide your home into three zones:

1. **War Zone**: Active renovation area—enter only with N95 mask
2. **Buffer Zone**: Transitional space—plastic sheets, temporary storage
3. **Safe Zone**: Your sealed sanctuary—protect at all costs

**Daily Schedule Hacks:**

- 7:30am: Wake up, use bathroom before workers arrive
- 8am-12pm: Leave house (workspace, library, mall)
- 12pm-1pm: Workers' lunch—your window for home tasks
- 1pm-5pm: Stay out or hide in Safe Zone with noise-canceling headphones
- 5pm onwards: Reclaim your space, assess damage

**The Dust War:**

- Buy 3M plastic sheets ($20) and blue tape ($15)—seal everything twice
- Two air purifiers minimum—one for Safe Zone, one portable
- Wet towels under doors—ancient but effective
- Change aircon filters week—they'll turn black daily

**Bathroom Survival Protocol:**

- Portable camping toilet ($40 from Decathlon)—lifesaver when they're working on pipes
- Gym membership ($68/month ActiveSG)—shower base
- Wet wipes economy pack—you'll use 20 daily
- Install temporary shower ($30 Shopee camping shower) in kitchen if needed

**Food Strategy:**

- Portable induction cooker + pot = endless possibilities
- Cooler box with ice packs—mini fridge alternative
- Paper plates/cups—dishwashing impossible
- Meal prep at friends' houses on weekends
- Food delivery backup list—include rider instructions: "RENOVATION UNIT—CALL DON'T KNOCK"

## The Punggol Test Case

My friend Sarah documented her 21-day renovation survival in excruciating detail. Her innovation changed everything:

**The Shift System**: She and her husband worked opposing schedules. He worked nights, slept during day drilling. She worked days, missed evening construction. They basically time-shared their misery.

**The Contractor Contract**: She made contractor sign specific agreements:

- No work before 8am (she recorded everything)
- One room must remain functional always
- 24-hour notice for utility cutoffs
- Designated smoking area (not her doorstep)
- Daily 5pm cleanup

Contractors who balked? She found others. "Your house, your rules," she insists.

Her masterstroke: She charged contractors $10/day for utilities usage, then used that money for gym memberships. "They're using my electricity and water anyway. Might as well fund my showers."

By day 21, she'd systemized everything so well, she claimed it was "almost manageable." Her marriage survived. Her sanity, debatable.

## Your Action Plan

- **First call**: Book backup accommodation for days 5-7 (peak frustration period). Even if unused, knowing you have escape option preserves sanity.
- **This weekend**: Buy supplies BEFORE renovation starts—air purifier, plastic sheets, camping equipment, therapy hotline number.
- **Before contractors arrive**: Establish ground rules in writing. Include penalties for violations. They'll resist. Insist.
- **Red flag to watch**: Contractor who says "very fast one, won't be so bad." He's lying or incompetent. It's always bad.
- **Budget hack**: Split stay with family/friends. Week 1 at parents', Week 2 at home. Preserves relationships and sanity.

## The Bottom Line

Living through renovation is voluntary torture that saves $2,000-3,000. It will test your marriage, your patience, and your respiratory system. But with military-grade planning and realistic expectations, it's survivable. Barely. The money saved can buy a very nice vacation to recover. You'll need it.
