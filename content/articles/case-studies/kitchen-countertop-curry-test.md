# Quartz vs Granite vs Solid Surface: I Spilled Curry on All Three (For Science)

"Quartz cannot stain one!" the salesman promised. Three days later, my $3,000 countertop had a permanent yellow shadow where my mother-in-law spilled her fish curry.

So I turned my kitchen into a science lab. Three countertop samples. Every Singaporean stain possible. Six months of testing. The results will shock you—and save you thousands.

## The Real Story

My Woodlands kitchen renovation hit a wall at countertop selection. Every supplier claimed theirs was best:

- Quartz seller: "Stain-proof, scratch-proof, everything-proof!"
- Granite uncle: "Natural stone lasts forever, quartz is fake!"
- Solid surface rep: "Can repair any damage, others cannot!"

Price quotes ranged from $1,800 to $4,500 for the same kitchen size. Nobody gave straight answers. So I bought samples of each and declared war on them.

The testing arsenal:

- Turmeric paste (the ultimate test)
- Fish curry (my MIL's nuclear version)
- Coffee (kopi-o, maximum darkness)
- Red wine (or Ribena for science)
- Sambal belacan
- Dark soy sauce
- Hot pot directly from stove
- Knife scratches
- House keys scratching

Each sample got tortured identically. Stains sat for 24 hours (worst case scenario). Heat exposure for 5 minutes. Scratching with same pressure. Then I tried every cleaning method possible.

The results destroyed everything salespeople told me.

## What Most People Don't Know

After 6 months of daily abuse, here's the brutal truth about each material:

**QUARTZ (Caesarstone sample - $3,200 quote)**

_The Good:_

- Survived soy sauce, coffee, wine without staining
- Hot pot (150°C) for 1 minute—no damage
- Scratches only from deliberate knife cutting
- Looks consistent, no random patterns

_The Surprise Failures:_

- Turmeric stained within 2 hours (permanent yellow)
- Curry stained if left overnight
- Hot pot over 3 minutes left white mark (permanent)
- Bleach cleaner caused discoloration

_Verdict:_ Great for Western cooking, struggles with Asian spices. Not as indestructible as claimed.

**GRANITE (Black Galaxy - $2,800 quote)**

_The Good:_

- NOTHING stained it (even turmeric gave up)
- Hot pot directly from fire—no effect
- Looks premium, unique patterns
- Actually gets better looking with age

_The Hidden Problems:_

- Needs resealing every year ($200)
- Without sealing, curry penetrates within hours
- Chipped from dropped ceramic bowl
- Cannot repair chips—permanent damage
- Bacteria can grow in natural pores

_Verdict:_ Best for staining IF you maintain it. Worst for damage repair.

**SOLID SURFACE (Corian sample - $2,200 quote)**

_The Good:_

- Every stain removed with sandpaper
- Every scratch buffed out easily
- Can be repaired infinite times
- Seamless joints (hygienic)
- Cheapest option

_The Disasters:_

- Hot pot = immediate permanent burn mark
- Turmeric stained badly (but removable)
- Scratches from everything (keys, plates, etc)
- Looks plastic-y, not premium
- Shows every fingerprint

_Verdict:_ Best for messy cooks who don't mind maintenance. Worst for heat and aesthetics.

**THE DARK HORSE: SINTERED STONE**

Nobody mentioned this option. Found it by accident at Hafary. Decided to test.

_Results:_

- NOTHING affected it
- Curry, turmeric, bleach—all failed
- Direct flame from torch—no damage
- Hammered it (for science)—survived
- Thinner than others (12mm vs 20mm)

_The Catch:_

- $4,500 (most expensive)
- Can chip if heavy items dropped at edge
- Limited design options
- Installation needs specialist

_Verdict:_ The Toyota Hilux of countertops. Overkill but bulletproof.

## The HDB Block 524 Test Kitchen

My neighbor runs a home baking business. She let me survey her baking group—32 home bakers across Singapore. Their long-term experiences:

**Quartz Owners (18 bakers):**

- 12 had turmeric stains
- 8 had heat marks from hot trays
- 3 cracked from heavy mixer dropping
- Overall satisfaction: 6/10

**Granite Owners (8 bakers):**

- 2 had staining (forgot to reseal)
- 5 had minor chips
- 1 had major crack (from dropped pot)
- Overall satisfaction: 7/10

**Solid Surface (4 bakers):**

- All had scratches
- All had heat marks
- But all damage was repaired
- Overall satisfaction: 8/10

**Surprising Discovery:**
The happiest owner had $800 ceramic tiles with $50 epoxy coating. Three years, heavy use, looked brand new. "Everyone pays thousands for countertops. I paid hundreds and got same result."

## Your Action Plan

- **First call**: Ask suppliers for samples, not brochures. Real testing beats any salesman promise.
- **This weekend**: Visit HDB showflat in Toa Payoh. They have all materials for comparison. Free and unbiased.
- **Before contractors arrive**: Order samples from Taobao ($5 each). Test yourself with your actual cooking style.
- **Red flag to watch**: Supplier who won't give samples or claims "no need to test." They're hiding something.
- **Budget hack**: Porcelain slabs from tile shops. Same look as quartz, fraction of price, better heat resistance.

## The Singapore Kitchen Reality Check

Based on your cooking style, here's what actually works:

**Heavy Asian Cooking (curry, sambal, frying):**

- 1st choice: Sintered stone (if budget allows)
- 2nd choice: Granite (if you'll maintain)
- Avoid: Solid surface (too much heat damage)

**Light Cooking (sandwiches, salads):**

- 1st choice: Quartz (beautiful, low maintenance)
- 2nd choice: Solid surface (cheap, repairable)
- Avoid: Granite (overkill)

**Baking/Heavy Use:**

- 1st choice: Solid surface (infinitely repairable)
- 2nd choice: Sintered stone (indestructible)
- Avoid: Quartz (heat marks from trays)

**Rental/Investment Property:**

- Only choice: Solid surface
- Why: Tenants will damage. You can repair. Others cannot.

## The Bottom Line

No countertop is perfect. Salespeople lie. Your curry doesn't care about marketing claims. Pick based on your actual cooking, not showroom beauty. And remember: a $50 bottle of sealer or sandpaper can fix what $3,000 can't replace.
