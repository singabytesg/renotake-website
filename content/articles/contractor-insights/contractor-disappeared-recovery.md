# My Contractor Disappeared with $15K - Here's Exactly What I Did Next

Tuesday, 8:47 AM: "Boss phone cannot reach. Deposit already bank in yesterday."
Tuesday, 8:48 AM: WhatsApp shows one grey tick.
Tuesday, 8:49 AM: His Facebook page deleted.
Tuesday, 8:50 AM: $15,000 gone.

But today, I got $12,000 back. Here's the exact playbook for when your contractor runs away with your money.

## The Real Story

Ken's Renovation seemed legitimate. HDB-licensed, 8 years in business, 200+ Facebook reviews, proper quotation, even had a Clementi showroom. I paid 50% deposit ($15,000) on Monday. Work supposed to start Wednesday.

Tuesday morning, his foreman called: "Boss cannot contact. Workshop locked." My heart dropped. Called the showroom—number disconnected. Rushed to Clementi—shutters down, notice from landlord for unpaid rent.

Classic signs I missed: Recently changed company name. All reviews from last 3 months. Insisted on bank transfer, not cheque. Pushed for immediate deposit. Showroom was just two weeks old.

My first instinct: panic. Second instinct: cry. Third instinct: Google "contractor run away Singapore what to do." Found horror stories, no solutions.

But I'm an ex-police officer. I know the system. Over the next 3 weeks, I recovered $12,000 through a combination of legal pressure, social media warfare, and strategic negotiation. He's also now facing criminal charges.

Here's exactly how.

## What Most People Don't Know

When contractors disappear, most victims do nothing. They assume the money's gone. Wrong. Here's the recovery playbook:

**HOUR 1-4: EVIDENCE LOCKDOWN**

- Screenshot everything—WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook, website
- Download all voice messages
- Save bank transfer records
- Document showroom/workshop address
- Check ACRA for company details
- Search his name in bankruptcy records

**DAY 1: LEGAL ACTIVATION**

- File police report (not online—go physically for urgency)
- Specific charge: Criminal breach of trust (Section 405)
- Not civil dispute—he took money without providing service
- Get Investigation Officer (IO) name and number
- File claim with CASE (Consumers Association)
- File report with HDB if he's licensed

**DAY 2-3: SOCIAL WARFARE**

- Post on ALL renovation Facebook groups
- Include his photo, company name, ACRA number
- Other victims will emerge (strength in numbers)
- Check if others already filing jointly
- Create WhatsApp group for victims

**DAY 4-7: THE HUNT**

- ACRA search shows his other companies
- Google his phone number—finds other ads
- Search his name on LinkedIn, property sites
- Find his home address through SingPass (if director)
- Check if still operating under different name

**WEEK 2: LEGAL PRESSURE**

- Lawyer letter to all known addresses ($500)
- Small Claims Tribunal if under $20,000 ($10 filing)
- Magistrate complaint if police "investigating" too slowly
- Contact his other clients (from ACRA info)

**WEEK 3: NEGOTIATION**

- He'll contact you through "friend" or "lawyer"
- Offer partial payment to drop charges
- Record everything, agree to nothing without legal advice
- Use leverage: criminal charges vs civil settlement

## The Bishan Recovery Coalition

Remember the "Bishan Renovation Massacre" of 2023? 47 victims, $890,000 total loss, one contractor. I joined their WhatsApp group to learn their tactics.

They organized like military operation:

- Hired one lawyer for group ($15,000 split 47 ways)
- Created comprehensive evidence database
- Tracked contractor's every movement
- Posted on his new company's reviews
- Attended his mother's void deck daily

Results:

- 31 victims recovered 60-80% of deposits
- Contractor charged criminally
- HDB banned him permanently
- His new company collapsed within weeks
- 8 victims who went solo recovered nothing

The key: Group pressure and persistence. One victim is ignorable. Forty-seven victims at your mother's void deck isn't.

My case: Found 11 other victims within 48 hours. We coordinated everything. Ken knew he couldn't fight all of us. His "lawyer" offered 80% settlement to drop charges. We accepted. Better than nothing.

## Your Action Plan

- **First call**: Police, then lawyer, then CASE. In that order. Speed matters—assets disappear quickly.
- **This weekend**: Join Singapore renovation Facebook groups NOW, before you need them. Build network before crisis.
- **Before contractors arrive**: Always pay by cheque, never exceed 30% deposit, verify HDB license personally.
- **Red flag to watch**: Contractor who's "too busy" to meet at registered address. No office = no accountability.
- **Budget hack**: Pay extra 2% for credit card. Chargeback protection worth more than any discount.

## The Prevention Protocol

After this nightmare, here's how I vet contractors now:

**The 7-Point Check:**

1. ACRA check: Company age, director names, address
2. HDB license: Call HDB directly, don't trust website
3. Google reviews: Look for reviews older than 6 months
4. Site visit: Must have physical location, not just "meet at your place"
5. Past projects: Ask for 3 recent contacts, actually call them
6. Payment terms: Maximum 30-40-10-10-10 (never 50% upfront)
7. Cheque only: To company name, never personal

**The Insurance Policy:**

- Renovation insurance: $50 covers up to $20,000 loss
- Credit card payment: Chargeback rights
- Progressive payment: Never pay ahead of work
- Document everything: Photos daily, receipts immediately

## The Bottom Line

When contractors disappear with your money, you have 72 hours to act effectively. After that, recovery drops dramatically. Don't be paralyzed by shock—follow the playbook. My $15,000 lesson became $12,000 recovery because I acted fast and fought smart. The system works if you work it aggressively.
