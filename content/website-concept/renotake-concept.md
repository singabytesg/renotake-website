# RenoTake Website Concept
**Singapore's Intelligent Renovation Guide**

## Executive Summary

RenoTake is a content-first website that empowers Singapore homeowners—particularly first-time BTO owners—to navigate their renovation journey with confidence. Through comprehensive guides, an AI-powered assistant, and practical tools, we fill the critical gap between inspiration-focused platforms and chaotic forums.

**Core Value:** We give you the knowledge to be a smarter renovation client, not sell you to a contractor.

## 1. Strategic Positioning

### 1.1 Target Audience
**Primary:** First-Time BTO Owners ("Anxious Planners")
- Age: 25-35 years old
- Timeline: 3-5 years pre-renovation planning phase
- Budget: S$30,000-50,000 for 4-room BTO
- Pain Points:
  - Fear of being overcharged by contractors
  - Confusion over HDB regulations and permits
  - Information overload from unstructured sources
  - Stress from making permanent, expensive decisions

### 1.2 Market Gap
| Current Platforms | What They Offer | What They Miss |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Qanvast | Beautiful portfolios, design inspiration | Process guidance, practical how-tos |
| HomeRenoGuru | Local project galleries, video tours | Deep regulatory knowledge, budgeting |
| Renotalk | Authentic user experiences | Structure, verification, efficiency |

**RenoTake fills this gap by focusing on the PROCESS, not just the PICTURES.**

**Example Interactions:**
```
User: "Can I hack the wall between my kitchen and living room?"
Bot: "For BTO flats, you can hack non-structural partition walls between the kitchen and living room, but you'll need an HDB permit (takes 3 days, costs $30). The wall must not be marked as structural in your floor plan. I recommend checking your unit's layout plan first - here's our guide on identifying structural walls: [link]"

User: "What's the difference between overlay and hacking for flooring?"
Bot: "Overlay ($8-15/sqft) involves installing new flooring directly over existing tiles - faster (3-5 days) and cheaper, but raises floor level by 5-15mm. Hacking ($25-40/sqft including disposal) removes existing tiles completely - takes 7-10 days with more dust and noise, but maintains original floor height. Most BTO owners choose overlay since their tiles are new. Here's our detailed comparison: [link]"
